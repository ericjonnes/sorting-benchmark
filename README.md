## Sorting Algorithm Benchmark
This project analyzes and compares the performance of multiple sorting algorithms by
measuring their execution time across varying input sizes. The goal is to observe
practical performance differences and trends as data input size increases.

## Overview
The program implements the Bubble Sort and Selection Sorting algorithms and 
benchmarks their runtime using randomly generated datasets. Execution times are 
recorded and compared to better understand how algorithm performance scales with 
input size.

## What This Project Demonstrates
* Understanding of fundamental sorting algorithms
* The ability to measure and compare runtime performance
* Exposure to algorithms efficiency and scalability
* Translating theoretical concepts into working code

## Technology Selection
* **Languages:** Java
* **Tools:** Standard Java libraries

## How it Works
1. Random datasets of varying sizes of [500], [2500], and [5000] are generated
2. Each sorting algorithm is run on the same data
3. Execution time is measured and recorded
4. Results are compared to observe performance trends
